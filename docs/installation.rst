Installation
************

From `PyPI <django-simple-email-auth-pypi>`_ (Recommended)::

    pip install django-simple-email-auth

From GitHub (latest code)::

    pip install git+https://github.com/cdriehuys/django-simple-email-auth.git

*************
Configuration
*************

Add ``email_auth`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``:

.. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        # Django apps

        # Third party apps

        # Core models and templates:
        "email_auth",

        # If you would like to use the provided REST API:
        "email_auth.interfaces.rest",

        # More third party apps

        # Your custom apps
    ]

Next ensure Django is `set up to send emails <django-emails>`_. Additionally,
ensure ``DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`` is set. This is the address that all account
related emails such as email verifications and password reset emails are sent
from.

See :ref:`app-settings` for configuration options.
